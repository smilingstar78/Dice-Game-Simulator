# 🎲 Dice Game Simulator  
**(6/21 Python Project Challenge)**  

## 📜 Project Description  
This is a simple yet exciting **Dice Game Simulator**, where 2 to 4 players compete to reach a maximum score of **100 points**. Players take turns rolling a die, deciding whether to take a risk and roll again or play it safe and bank their points. But beware—rolling a **1** means losing all your points for that turn!

This project is part of my **21 Python Project Challenge** and demonstrates the use of Python loops, conditionals, user input, and the `random` module.

## 🕹️ Game Rules  
1. **Players**: The game supports **2 to 4 players**.  
2. **Objective**: Be the first to score **100 points or more**.  
3. **Turn Rules**:  
   - Each player rolls a die during their turn.

     - **Roll again** (risk losing your points if you roll a 1).  
     - **End your turn** and add the points for that round to your total score.
